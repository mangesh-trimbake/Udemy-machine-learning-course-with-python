            <p>Time to try some exercises:</p><ol><li>Try out other machine learning algorithms to gain an appreciation of their performance. Compare them against those that we have done. For a start try out Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and when you are more confident Gradient Boosting Machine, XGBoost, and kNN.</li><li>Try performing hyperparameter tuning</li><li> Instead of training on one digit as we did here, try training all (0 to 9). Evaluate the performance of all the various machine learning algorithms.</li></ol>
